Scannings indicate that these ruins bear the marks of at least 364 different galactic civilizations, some of which match that of the fallen empire's insignia.\n\nWhile ship graveyards like this are not uncommon, what makes this one extremely special, is that we detect that many ships here do not match any known designs of past records, some appears to actually be intact, almost untouched.\n\nA massive space station in the epicenter seems to hold the clues to the puzzle, we should investigate."

The Team has also located massive amounts of minor artifacts scattered across the area and large stockpiles of both dark matter and dark energy deposits.\n\nSome of the scientists advises we return the artifacts to their proper locations, while the military commanders believe resources could be of great use to our war efforts. Experts however believe we should delay the exploration until we understand more of these ancient technologies."

Apparently, our instincts and theories have been proven correct, things could have gone much worse had we not choose wisely. The mechanism could not operate with any kind of materials or resources save for the ones located around the vault. At worst, it would have exploded and destroyed the planet in a chain reaction. The system would have also reactively harvested nearby materials to substitute the missing stockpiles, this can include biological and mechanical materials, which would have put the Excavation Team at great risk. Finally, if too much resources were to be provided, the system would have allocated exceeding resources to power up inactive warships and repair damaged hulls through hard-light reassembling. It would have been a disaster as the ships would run on ancient IFF systems and begin their long-forgotten wars over again.\n\nThe Path to the Vault is now open!"

Our stupidity and greed has caused us dearly and the only thing left amongst this shattered world is a small dent of leftover debris.\n\nBut the team is convinced that there is perhaps something left to be studied."
acot_digsite_events.4.a.1: "If only we were not so dumb..."
 
acot_digsite_events.4.b.desc: "§YGhosts of the Past§!\n\nThe Vault has successfully been breached, and the expedition team has made as much study as they can from its interior. The vault is ancient but extremely advanced. Remains of dead aliens are found everywhere, many of which seem to be wearing lab coats and working uniforms. This leads up to believe this ship must have been a science vessel of some kind, albeit on a much larger scale than one typically fielded by any we have seen.\n\nEventually, the team reaches a big chamber which appears to be a reactor room. Perhaps with some kind of power source, we may be able to power up the entire vault again?\n\nIf we are to use more advanced reactors, we will need sufficient resources to install them. The options will not appear if we do not have enough resources or technologies."
acot_digsite_events.4.b.1: "Hmm...use 2200-era Fusion Reactor."
acot_digsite_events.4.b.1.explain: "Ancient though these technologies maybe, they cannot be compared to the awesome reactor our people developed in 2200. It is better to save up resources for more important tasks.\n\nIf this stupid ship cannot operate on a Fusion Reactor, then it clearly is too weak, too pathetic to be of any use to us anyway."
acot_digsite_events.4.b.2: "Zero Point Reactor should do."
acot_digsite_events.4.b.2.explain: "Zero Point Reactor represents the most advanced modern reactor utilized by the galactic community, it generates sufficient output to power even the Juggernaut and requires relatively low costs. It should be sufficient to power up important parts of the ship."
acot_digsite_events.4.b.3: "Try the Enhanced ZP Reactor."
acot_digsite_events.4.b.3.explain: "There is no telling just how much do you need energy to operate this level of technology. Our goal is to gain entrance, not to light the whole place up, some of our archelogists argue that we should maintain the delicate balance between how much we feed the energy. The enhanced version of the Zero Point Reactor provides the most optimal condition for this. It should provide sufficient power, without awakening other surprise mechanics the system may has in store."
acot_digsite_events.4.b.4: "Use the Delta Reactor."
acot_digsite_events.4.b.4.explain: "There is no doubt that this is yet another relic of the ancient precursors, which means at the bare minimum we can expect that Enigmatic energies will be involved. Delta Reactor seems to slot in perfectly into this puzzle, and may be just what we need to get our answers. The only concenn is whether we may wake up something other than the door's mechanisms?"

There is literally nothing of value left to be discovered in this former ancient world. The only thing the team is able to discover is a black box that contains a single green apple that has been preserved for over 100,000 years.\n\nThis somehow gives the team some semblance of hope that perhaps there could be more of these black boxes, with something worth studying?"

acot_digsite_events.5.b.desc: "§RThe Air Conditioner?§!\n\nAgainst all bets, the Fusion Reactor does actually manage to power up the Vault...for five seconds. After that the power output dropped so low that the only thing that stills operate normally is a single air conditioner. Just as when the team prepares to replace the ineffective reactor with a better one, the device breaks, and the entire interior begins to crumble.\n\nWhatever secrets that is hidden in this vault can thus no longer be studied, and there is nothing else we can do with the massive vessel other than salvage it for materials.

acot_digsite_events.1005.a.response: "Precisely. The ship was purchased by one of our many customers in the past and took part in a battle that involved the A'merigo. Seeing as the ship's original owner is no more, we'd like to reclaim the asset itself for security reasons."

The designs were specific and have proven to be effective enough that it became a new standard for the later generations of Star Dominator, the Mark II variants. The original ship itself took part in the battle of the A'merigo. We understand that the captain had decided to ram the ship into the station, thus causing its doom. The name "Kylo Ren" seems to vaguely translate to "He Who Rages Against Fate" in the original buyer's language. Fitting name, considering its history."

acot_digsite_events.1005.d: "What if we refuse?"
acot_digsite_events.1005.d.response: "That would be unfortunate, but seeing as you're the one who reclaimed it, it is indeed within your rights to keep it.
