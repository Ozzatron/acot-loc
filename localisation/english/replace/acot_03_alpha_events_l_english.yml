 must_know_about_fe: "§RWe do not have any inclination as to the mysteries held behind this door, much less the knowledge of this door's existence.§!\n\n§YRequires us to be aware of ancient civilizations, or in posession of ancient buildings that display concrete evidences of dimensional manipulation.§!"

 acot_will_lock_alpha: "§RChoosing this ascension will lock our empire to a specific technological progression that is geared towards the ultimate goal of escaping the confines of this galaxy. Once committed, we will not be able to pursue other paths. We should take great consideration before leading ourselves towards a path that may forever define our destiny.§!\n\n§YAdditional Effect:§! Locks your empire from Alpha tier progression, but gains Cosmogenesis-unique progession instead. Does not lock Delta tier progression."

 acot_alpha_tech_chain_title: "Mystery of the Precursors"
 acot_alpha_tech_chain_desc: "Evidence of a more advanced enigmatic technologies utilized by the ancient precursors have been found across multiple reference points. The term "Precursor Data Bank Personality" has been mentioned multiple times. Our scientists believe that this archive must be the key to the secrets of the past, an ancient cache of technologies to be opened."
 acot_precursor_tech_find: "Prototype Reactor"
 acot_dm_tech_find_enigmatic_desc: "While we cannot harness the power of Dark Matter yet, our scientists are quite confident that we can begin developing a prototype enigmatic energy first. While this is not a requirement, it should provide a good steppingstone for our ship technologies. This point of interest will be removed at the conclusion of Dark Designs Event."

 acot_alpha_matter_events.100.name: "Mystery of the Precursors"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.100.a.desc: "Some of our scientists have been studying the technologies behind the designs of the fallen one's spaceships in an effort to find possible improvements for our technologies. What they have discovered is however something far more interesting. Apparently the energy readings from the technologies utilized by the fallen ones seem to be far lower than one would have expected from dark matter and dark energy-based systems.\n\nAfter a lengthy process of searching and studying, it appears that all of the current technologies utilized by the fallen ones are extremely downscaled and simplified versions of their original prototypes. The term "Precursor Databank" has been heavily referenced across multiple pieces of evidence. We believe that the next stage of dark matter evolution lies within this Databank. We must find a way to access it."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.100.b.desc: "Some of our scientists have been wasting time trying to study the technologies behind the designs of the fallen one's spaceships. What they have discovered is somewhat unexpected. They claimed that the energy readings from the technologies utilized by the fallen ones seem to be far lower than one would have expected from dark matter and dark energy-based systems.\n\nAfter a lengthy process of searching and studying, it appears that all of the current technologies utilized by the fallen ones are extremely downscaled and simplified versions of their original prototypes. The term "Precursor Databank Archives" has been heavily referenced across multiple pieces of evidence. They believe that the next stage of dark matter evolution lies within this Databank.\n\nHowever, many others remain unconvinced, believing that these scientists are simply trying to spread false claims to gain more recognition. The [root.GetName] is at its zenith, and that we should look to conquer the galaxy, not trying to chase old ghosts."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.100.a: "And we shall."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.100.b: "These claims have merit, we should investigate."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.100.b.explain: "It will take some political plays to get the Science Board to agree on further investigation. But the risks should be well rewarded, if these theories are indeed correct."

 acot_databank_trick_fe_desc: "The Fallen Ones must possess one of these databanks. Perhaps if we gain enough favor with the Fallen Ones, they can be tricked to allow us to gain access to the databank if we pamper them with enough praise. We simply need them to have high opinions of us somehow."
 
 acot_databank_ask_pmc: "Phanon Corps Assist"
 acot_databank_ask_pmc_desc: "While our attempts to study the past will likely not escape the attention of the Fallen Empires, we may be able to ask the Corps to aid us in contacting them, and perhaps make the whole deal way more smooth."
 
 acot_databank_ask_curator: "Calculating Curators"
 acot_databank_ask_curator_desc: "Perhaps the Curators will be able to help us acquire a databank, provided that we are still on good terms with them."
 
 acot_databank_self_assembly: "Self Assembly"
 acot_databank_self_assembly_desc: "The Databank was of an ancient precursor design. Perhaps we can reassemble a new databank ourselves using current resources. But the databank is useless without data, so we're going to have to harvest loads of minor artifacts to combine them up.\n\n§YUse the Assemble Databank from the Relic Tab to begin the attempt.§!\n§RThere is a great chance of failure doing it this way!§!"

 acot_alpha_matter_events.9007.desc.a: "Red Alert! Some of our fleets have been hacked by an unidentified rogue machine intelligence!\n\nIntel suggests this is the result of a flawed design made by [event_target:current_uprising_originator.GetName], who is now suffering from a massive machine uprising of unprecedented scale."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.9007.desc.b: "Warning! [event_target:current_uprising_originator.GetName], in their sloppiness to create a Databank without proper understanding, has unleashed a powerful rogue Precursor Intelligence into the galaxy. The Intelligence is now causing massive chaos everywhere.\n\nFortunately for us, SOPHIA has shielded all of our fleets from being hijacked, but we will have to watch closely."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.9007.a: "Damn these idiots! Repel the hostiles!"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.9007.a.explain: "Many empire's fleets, including ours have been hijacked by a rogue berserk AI!"

We who have walked this path before know full well of the danger and futility of this quest. So we suggest you abandon your misguided attempt at learning the sins of the past while you have the chance."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.104.desc.spiritualist.patronize: "[root.GetName], it has come to our attention that your empire is seeking knowledge of the past precursors such as ours. What exactly do you plan to accomplish.\n\nYou are not trying to find our weaknesses, are you? Given that you have been such a good follower to the faith, we permit you the chance to explain your actions this once."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.104.desc.spiritualist.loyal: "[root.GetRulerName], you have done well as our most promising acolyte. Your scion empire, under our guidance, has come quite far. You exceed every expectations, and have surpassed many before you. Thus do we believe that you are worthy of the knowledge that you seek, and the Faith has seen fit to bestow you this grand purpose. Use them well, acolyte."

In this we are proud that our guidance has proven to be effective. Yet we feel a growing discontent in your faith. You're losing yourself, my child. Dare we grant you the knowledge that you so crave, knowing that it may not align with the destiny that have been entrusted to you?"

 acot_alpha_matter_events.104.desc.materialist: "This is [From.GetRulerName] addressing to [root.GetRulerName]. Our intelligences have detected that your scientists have been seen snooping around the technologies of the old. And that is a violation of the parameters and regulations we have established. You have already been given many leeways with your wantom pursuit of many dangerous arcane knowledge. What you have is sufficient to conquer and rule this galaxy, what need do you have of such a knowledge marred with failures and danger?"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.104.desc.materialist.patronize: "This is the representative of [From.GetName] addressing to [root.GetRulerName]. Our intelligences have detected that your scientists have been seen snooping around the technologies of the old. Normal regulations suggest we confiscate all plebian's data regarding the dangerous acquisition of forbidden artifacts, but since you have shown to be trustworthy in the past, we shall give you the opportunity to not waste both of our times by explaining to us what is your goal."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.104.desc.materialist.loyal: "We see that you're progressing nicely as we had hope, [root.GetRulerName]. And now you seek to learn more about us, about your future.

 acot_alpha_matter_events.104.a: "We want to bask in your empire's glorious achievements."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.104.a.response: "Are you now? How very humble.\n\nVery well, enjoy your history lessons then, perhaps you will come to understand why we consider ourselves superior civilizations. Your empire's history is but a fraction of our vast achievements, for ours is a story that spans for eons. Study well and spread the words of our excellence. Let the...<blah blah blah>\n\n<5 hours later> ...ends the reign of our great expansion. Write those histories down and spread the words to the rest of the galaxy so that it may yet be saved.\n\n<<Such is the endless rambling that the Fallen Ruler ushers upon our leaders that the agony inflicted  from hours of the Fallen Empire's self-glorifying braggings has caused everyone to lose a portion of their sanity.>>"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.104.a.response.refuse: "Do not think us fools, [root.GetName]. We know of your distastes against us, and any interests you have in our designs cannot be borne out of genuine respect. Out with it, what exactly is your goal."

 acot_alpha_matter_events.102.a: "Can you speak on our behalf?"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.102.a.response: "We can do that, but that will cost more. Uses the word "Sobrak", it will soften their wills."

############################ CURATORS
 
 acot_alpha_matter_events.ask_curator: "Can you help us acquire a databank?"
 
 acot_alpha_matter_events.103.name: "Databank Acquisition."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.103.desc: "Databank? We're not sure you truly understand its function. The databank is not just some information storage. It contains countless data and knowledge beyond our galaxy, and it can only be activated through proper authorization or with the authority of a Databank Personality. None of which are present in this galaxy.\n\nStill, if you wish to try to create one, we will help what we can. But as per usual, this will have to be done as a service."
 
 acot_alpha_matter_events.103.a: "What do you know of the databank?"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.103.a.response: "Technically speaking, the databank is simply a function of the actual device. We believe the proper term for the entire package is called "The Ancient Cache of Technology", possibly made by one of the ancients that predated many. Such caches do not exist in this galaxy, however. We Curators and perhaps the Fallen Empires may possess ancient databank intelligences, but they have since became dormant, and none has been able to activate them again. It is as if the databank rejects us somehow."
 
 acot_alpha_matter_events.103.b: "So it is possible to make an entirely new databank?"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.103.b.response: "Technically possible. yes. You simply need to replicate the designs of the databank, a blank one. If you manage to do it properly, it will attempt to find authorization code, which you obviously do not have. Which means your only chance is for a successful connection to an existing databank personality to be made.\n\nSuch is the mystery of the ancient technologies, even if one manages to replicate the design, the knowledge contained therein may not easily yield itself, not even to its new creators."
 
 acot_alpha_matter_events.103.c: "We'll think about it."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.103.c.response: "Take your time. There're multiple ways in which the databank may be made, but using our service is most likely the safest method, so please take that under consideration."
 
 acot_alpha_matter_events.103.d: "Looks like you'll be getting more donations then."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.103.d.response: "Excellent! Our experts will have a new database delivered soon. Please wait just a moment."

 acot_alpha_matter_events.3.name: "Alpha Project Report"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.3.desc.engi: "After extensive analysis of the Precursor's history of their designs, materials and components, our scientists has finally reached the conclusion that the majority of the reasons that led to the Project's failure lies in the massive misuderstanding of the power manipulation, or perhaps the entire field of study. Dark Energy, previosuly thought to be connected to Dark Matter, appears to have been entirely independent source of power, something called Enigmatic Powers. At this time, we do not have the capabilities to correct this error and repurpose our arsenals and equipment, the new study being as vagued as it is.\n\nRegardless, with this knowledge, we can begin to see possible changes. More efforts will be made to implement more strategic resources in place of conventional ones in order to create something greater."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.3.desc.hist: "Per our instructions, our archivists, historians and master librarians have completed their documentations regarding the reign of the Precursors and their vast histories. The chaotic influences of the Ascension War and the massive lack of coordination between the science team, the political powers and the military leaders were the major factor that led to the failures of the Alpha Project. Major flaws in internal securities led to the Project being canceled after massive rejections made by various opposing factions, most of which were theorized to be agents employed by enemy powers.\n\nArmed with this knowledge, our empire has come to a greater understanding of how important strength in unity plays a role in achieving great ambitions. We shall not fail. The Alpha Project will be completed under our flag."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.3.desc.phys: "Our science teams are pleased to report that their analysis on all Precursor's experimental records have been completed. The key to the success of Alpha Project lies in the optimal balances between Dark Matter and Dark Energy's convergence. The Precursors have failed multiple times to maintain the focus between them which results in massive explosions and a lot of black holes.\n\nAfter some minor setbacks of our own, we have finally completed what they have failed. The Alpha Project gets closer and closer to its completion."

The time for doubts and concerns are behind us.\n\nThere is no time to be lost! [root.GetSpeciesName]! Science Team! Today, the future is at our door! We know our duty and we will do it. We fight for our honor, as [root.GetSpeciesName], as [root.GetName], and we fight in the name of [root.GetRulerName]!"
